# Testing strategy

Two layers: **static checks** that run anywhere (CI/dev laptop), and a **manual acceptance plan** on disposable VMs, because the tool's essence — package installs, PKI, PAM, firewalls, systemd — only manifests on a real system.

## 1. Static checks (every commit)

```bash
# Syntax check every module
bash -n openvpn-manager.sh lib/*.sh

# Lint (informational; SC1091 for sourced files is expected)
shellcheck -x openvpn-manager.sh lib/*.sh

# No CRLF line endings (would break on Linux)
grep -rlI $'\r' openvpn-manager.sh lib/ && echo "CRLF found!" || echo OK
```

## 2. Test matrix

Run the acceptance plan on at least:

| VM | Why |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 (fresh) | primary target, ufw variant |
| Debian 12 (fresh) | primary target, no-firewall variant (raw iptables backend) |
| Rocky/Alma 9 | firewalld + EPEL + `nobody` group path |
| Ubuntu re-run | idempotency / upgrade behaviour |

Suggested harness: Vagrant/libvirt or cloud snapshots; snapshot before install so every scenario starts clean. A second VM (or your laptop) with an OpenVPN client ≥ 2.5 acts as the client.

## 3. Acceptance plan

Each step lists the action and the **pass criteria**.

### 3.1 Fresh installation

1. `sudo ./openvpn-manager.sh` → guided install, defaults, Cloudflare DNS.
   - ✅ finishes without error; `systemctl is-active openvpn-server@server` = `active`
   - ✅ `ss -lunp | grep 1194` shows OpenVPN listening
   - ✅ `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` = 1
   - ✅ firewall backend matches the system (ufw active → ufw rules; else unit `openvpn-manager-iptables` active)
   - ✅ `/etc/openvpn-manager/config.conf` exists, mode `0600`
2. Reboot the VM.
   - ✅ service and firewall rules come back by themselves.

### 3.2 User lifecycle

1. Add user `alice` (no key passphrase).
   - ✅ `/etc/openvpn-manager/clients/alice.ovpn` exists, `0600`, contains `<ca>`, `<cert>`, `<key>`, `<tls-crypt>` blocks
2. Add user `bob` **with** key passphrase.
   - ✅ `grep ENCRYPTED /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/bob.key`
3. Invalid inputs: username `../evil`, `server_x`, `röt`, empty.
   - ✅ all rejected with a clear message, nothing created
4. List users. ✅ both appear with expiry dates.

### 3.3 Certificate-only connection

1. Copy `alice.ovpn` to the client machine; `openvpn --config alice.ovpn`.
   - ✅ `Initialization Sequence Completed`
   - ✅ client's public IP (`curl ifconfig.me`) = server IP; DNS resolves
   - ✅ server Service→status shows alice connected
2. IPv6 (if enabled): ✅ `curl -6 ifconfig.co` works from the client.

### 3.4 Revocation

1. Revoke `bob`. ✅ confirmation is default-No; after confirming, `bob.ovpn` gone, TOTP/YubiKey entries gone.
2. Try connecting with a *saved copy* of `bob.ovpn`.
   - ✅ connection rejected (CRL); server log shows verify failure.

### 3.5 Password authentication

1. Switch mode to *Certificate + password*; set password for `alice`; regenerate profiles.
   - ✅ `/etc/pam.d/openvpn` exists (`0600`) with `pam_succeed_if` + `pam_unix`
   - ✅ `alice.ovpn` now contains `auth-user-pass`
   - ✅ `getent shadow alice` shows a hash, account shell is `nologin`
2. Connect with correct username+password. ✅ success.
3. Wrong password → ✅ `AUTH_FAILED`. Username `carol` (no such user) → ✅ `AUTH_FAILED`.
4. Username `alice` + *bob's* certificate (recreate bob first) → ✅ `AUTH_FAILED` (CN match).
5. `ssh alice@server` with the VPN password → ✅ refused (nologin shell).

### 3.6 Password + TOTP

1. Switch mode to *password + TOTP*; enroll `alice` (scan QR in a TOTP app); regenerate profiles.
   - ✅ QR renders in terminal; `/etc/openvpn-manager/totp/alice` mode `0400`
   - ✅ `alice.ovpn` contains the `static-challenge` line
   - ✅ `grep -r <base32 secret> /var/log/` finds **nothing**
2. Connect: password + current 6-digit code. ✅ success.
3. Reuse the *same* code immediately. ✅ rejected (DISALLOW_REUSE).
4. Wrong/expired code. ✅ `AUTH_FAILED`.
5. Reset TOTP → old app entry fails, new one works.
6. Toggle per-user-optional (nullok), add user `dave` without TOTP → ✅ dave connects with password only; toggle back → ✅ dave rejected.

### 3.7 YubiKey OTP

1. Configure YubiCloud API key; *Validate a test OTP*. ✅ "Success".
2. Register alice's key. ✅ `authorized_yubikeys` contains `alice:<12-char id>`.
3. Switch mode to *Certificate + YubiKey OTP*; regenerate; connect with username + key touch. ✅ success.
4. Replay the same OTP (saved from a text editor touch). ✅ rejected.
5. Another (unregistered) YubiKey's OTP for alice. ✅ rejected.
6. Switch to *password + YubiKey* → ✅ both password and touch required.
7. Unregister the key → ✅ login fails; register again → works.

### 3.8 Service & config management

1. Restart from the Service menu. ✅ comes back active; clients auto-reconnect.
2. Change port 1194→1195. ✅ old firewall rule gone, new one present, server listens on 1195, regenerated profile connects.
3. Change DNS to Quad9. ✅ client resolver = 9.9.9.9 after reconnect.
4. Break `server.conf` on purpose (as the tool would after a bad change) → restart fails → ✅ journal shown automatically, backup exists under `backups/`.

### 3.9 Idempotent re-run

1. Run the script again on the configured server.
   - ✅ opens the management menu (no re-install prompt walk-through), status line correct.
2. Choose *Reinstall*. ✅ two default-No confirmations; after completion old profiles are invalid (new PKI) — expected and warned.

### 3.10 Uninstall

1. Main menu → Uninstall (accept package removal).
   - ✅ backup archive `/root/openvpn-manager-backup-*.tar.gz`, mode `0600`
   - ✅ service gone, unit gone, `/etc/openvpn` gone, PAM file gone
   - ✅ `getent group openvpn-users` empty; alice/dave accounts removed
   - ✅ firewall rules removed **and** pre-existing rules (e.g. the ufw SSH allow) untouched
   - ✅ `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` back to 0 (unless set elsewhere)
2. Re-install afterwards. ✅ works on the same box.

### 3.11 Dependency validation scenarios (v1.1.0)

Each row: perform the action in the given broken state. **Pass criteria for every row:** no hang, no crash, no partial change; a "Missing requirements" screen lists the gaps with severity and reason; the fix menu offers the listed actions plus *Return to previous menu*; after cancelling, the previous menu is fully functional.

| # | Scenario (state → action) | Expected requirements shown | Expected fix offers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Auth mode = cert → Register YubiKey for `alice` | global YubiKey mode disabled (warning); API unconfigured (warning) | configure API; proceed anyway; back |
| 2 | No Yubico API configured → Register YubiKey | validation service (warning) | configure now |
| 3 | `libpam-yubico` not installed → Register YubiKey | PAM module (blocking) | install package |
| 4 | Fresh cert-only server → enable YubiKey mode | pam_yubico (blocking), API (blocking), no registered keys (warning) | install, configure, register |
| 5 | Register YubiKey for non-existing user | user (blocking) — reachable only via fix-menu path; user pickers already exclude unknown names | back |
| 6 | User already has a key → register same key again | "already registered" message; add-vs-replace menu for a different key | n/a |
| 7 | `libpam-google-authenticator` missing → Generate TOTP | PAM module (blocking) | install package |
| 8 | Mandatory TOTP, zero enrolled users → enable password+TOTP mode | enrollment coverage (warning) | generate secret now |
| 9 | PAM plugin file removed → enable password mode | OpenVPN PAM plugin (blocking) | none (reinstall hint) |
| 10 | Delete `pki/private/alice.key` → regenerate alice's profile | user cert/key (blocking) | back |
| 11 | `systemctl disable --now openvpn-server@server; rm unit` → Service→restart | restart fails; journal shown; menu returns | n/a |
| 12 | Delete `/etc/openvpn/server/server.conf` only → start tool | "Incomplete installation detected (found: PKI …)" on the install menu | Install = repair |
| 13 | Kill installer mid-PKI-generation → restart tool | same partial-state banner; reinstall succeeds | n/a |
| 14 | Truncate `/etc/openvpn-manager/config.conf` mid-file → start tool | starts normally; missing keys use defaults | n/a |
| 15 | Corrupt values (`PORT=abc`, `AUTH_MODE=banana`, `YUBICO_URL=::`) → start tool | starts; log shows "Config sanitized … PORT AUTH_MODE YUBICO_URL"; menus show sane defaults | n/a |
| 16 | `chmod 644` a TOTP secret + the PAM file → any auth action | permissions (warning) | tighten permissions now |
| 17 | Run via `ssh host sudo ./openvpn-manager.sh < /dev/null` (no tty) | plain-text mode, EOF on prompts exits cleanly — no invisible-dialog hang | n/a |

Also verify the audit log after 1–4: lines like `Switch authentication mode … blocked: YubiKey validation service (blocking)` and **no** secrets/OTP/API-key values anywhere in `/var/log/openvpn-manager.log`.

### 3.12 Crypto configuration scenarios (v1.2.0)

| # | Scenario | Pass criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fresh install, accept recommended defaults | Crypto step shows "ECDSA prime256v1 \| AES-256-GCM:… \| TLS>=1.2 \| tls-crypt \| SHA256"; after install `server.conf` contains `ecdh-curve prime256v1`, `tls-crypt`, `data-ciphers`, `data-ciphers-fallback`; config file contains all `PKI_*`/`DATA_*`/`TLS_MIN`/`CONTROL_WRAP`/`*_DAYS` keys |
| 2 | Fresh install, RSA-4096 preset | `openssl x509 -in pki/ca.crt -noout -text` shows RSA 4096; server.conf `tls-cipher` uses `ECDHE-RSA`; client connects |
| 3 | Fresh install, custom ECDSA P-384 + AES-256-GCM only + TLS 1.3 + SHA384 | cert curve = secp384r1; `tls-version-min 1.3`; no `tls-cipher` line (1.3 suites only); modern client connects |
| 4 | Custom cipher list: enter `AES-256-CBC` or `BF-CBC` | rejected at input with the AEAD whitelist message — never written anywhere |
| 5 | Custom validity: client 5000 days, CA 3650 | blocked: "certificates cannot outlive the CA"; re-prompt |
| 6 | tls-auth selected | warned (default No); if confirmed: server.conf has `tls-auth tls-crypt.key 0`, profile has `key-direction 1` + `<tls-auth>`; client connects |
| 7 | Unsupported selection vs installed OpenVPN (simulate: temporarily shadow `openvpn` with a stub whose `--show-ciphers` output is empty) | install step "Validate crypto settings" fails visibly; offer to reset-to-defaults or abort; no PKI generated on abort |
| 8 | Existing server → Server config → Crypto → runtime change (e.g. TLS min 1.2→1.3) | old→new confirmation lists the exact impact; after apply: server.conf regenerated, service restarted, profile regeneration offered; **old** profile fails, **regenerated** profile connects |
| 9 | Existing server → change validity periods | message "applies to future certificates"; new user's cert expiry reflects the new setting, existing certs unchanged |
| 10 | Existing server → try to change key type | explanatory dialog pointing to Reinstall; nothing changed |
| 11 | Pre-1.2.0 config file (no crypto keys) | starts cleanly; defaults identical to the previously hardcoded values; regenerated profiles stay compatible with existing clients |
| 12 | Corrupt crypto values (`PKI_ALGO=des`, `DATA_CIPHERS=BF-CBC`, `CA_DAYS=999999`) | start: log shows "Crypto settings sanitized …"; menus show the recovered defaults |

### 3.13 Per-user authentication & enforcement scenarios (v2.0.0)

Setup for most rows: fresh install with allowed modes = all five, then users
`certy` (cert), `pwonly` (password), `pt` (password_totp), `yk` (yubikey),
`pyk` (password_yubikey), each provisioned during Add user.

| # | Scenario | Pass criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | All five users connect **at the same time** | each succeeds with exactly its own factors; `status.log` shows all five |
| 2 | `certy` connects with no credentials | connects; journal shows no PAM activity for the login |
| 3 | `pwonly` connects with no credentials (hand-edited profile without `auth-user-pass`) | rejected; journal: `auth-policy: DENY cn=pwonly - mode 'password' requires a username/password login` |
| 4 | `pt` uses `pwonly`'s username with `pt`'s certificate | rejected: `username does not match the certificate` |
| 5 | `yk` login: password field = one key touch | connects; replaying the same OTP fails (single-use) |
| 6 | `pyk` login: password immediately + key touch in one field | connects; wrong password + valid OTP fails; valid password + missing OTP fails |
| 7 | Enforcement: allowed = {password_totp, password_yubikey} (spec example 1) | impact screen lists `certy`, `pwonly`, `yk`; choosing *apply anyway* needs a default-No confirm; afterwards those three are rejected with `mode … not allowed by the enforcement rules` while `pt`/`pyk` still connect |
| 8 | Enforcement: same change but choose *update users now* | guided per-user mode pick; updated users connect with new factors; unfixed ones listed as still blocked |
| 9 | Enforce a single mode (password_totp) for everyone (spec example 3) | non-compliant users listed before apply; after updates, every login requires password+TOTP |
| 10 | Assign TOTP mode while `pam_google_authenticator` missing | requirements screen (blocking) with install fix; no partial change |
| 11 | Assign YubiKey mode with no validation service | **blocking** requirement with configure fix; after configuring inline, assignment continues |
| 12 | Assign a mode not in the allowed list | blocked with "edit the allowed modes now" fix that opens the enforcement checklist |
| 13 | Cancel the password prompt mid-assignment | "nothing has been changed"; user keeps the old mode (verify with a login) |
| 14 | Per-user screen: password_totp → *Remove TOTP* | mode becomes password; offered (default No) to delete the secret; login now needs only password |
| 15 | Revoke `pt` | policy entry, account, groups, secret, profile all gone; `auth-policy.conf` has no `pt` line |
| 16 | Cert exists but policy entry deleted by hand | login rejected (`no policy entry`); Validate screen FAILs the user; re-assigning a mode fixes it |
| 17 | `Validate authentication configuration` on a healthy setup | all PASS; then break one thing (e.g. remove a gate group with `gpasswd -d`) and re-run → targeted FAIL line |
| 18 | v1.x upgrade: install v1.2.2 in mode password_totp with 2 users (one without a TOTP secret), then run v2 | migration summary proposes password_totp + downgrade-to-password for the unenrolled user; after apply both users connect; declining leaves v1 behaviour running and menus locked behind the migration offer |
| 19 | v1.x `password_yubikey` upgrade | migration warns that the login format changed and offers regenerating all profiles; old profile fails, new one connects |
| 20 | Interrupted configuration: kill the tool between TOTP enrollment and commit | user keeps the old mode; re-running the tool shows a consistent state (stray secret is inert); Validate screen clean |

Also verify after 3, 4, 7: journal `auth-policy: DENY` lines contain the CN and a fixed reason only — never passwords, OTP values or secrets.

## 4. Regression quick-list

After any code change, minimally re-run: 3.1(1), 3.2(1), 3.3, 3.5(2), 3.6(2), 3.10, 3.13(1).
